## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Input Formats:**
   - .mp4 Video File
   - PDF File
   - .mp3 / .wav Audio File

2. **Processing:**
   - Extracts relevant content from the input.
   - Uses an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini) to analyze and summarize the content.

3. **Output:**
   - Displays the summary directly on the web page.

## 🖥️ Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- An OpenAI API Key.
- Ollama's Open source Models.
- Ensure you have ffmpeg installed and added to PATH, for Speech-to-Text conversion.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/brickster241/LLM_Projects.git
   ```

2. Go inside directory, create and activate environment and install required dependencies using Anaconda:
   ```bash
   cd MultiMedia-LLM-Summarization-Tool
   conda create --name llm_env python=3.11
   conda activate llm_env
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add a `.env` file, containing `OPEN_API_KEY=yourAPIKey`.

4. In case you want to use LLMs other than `gpt-4o-mini`, install Ollama and download models : 
   ```bash
   ollama run gemma:7b
   ollama run qwen2.5:7b
   ollama run llama3.2:3b
   ollama run mistral:7b
   ```
